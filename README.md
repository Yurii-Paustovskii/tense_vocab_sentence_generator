# tense_vocab_sentence_generator
Generates sentences with needed vocabulary and grammar tense.
It works as a sript run from CMD and takes two arguments: 1) a word; 2) a tense (in form of Present_Simple, Past_Perfect_Continuous etc.)
As a result, you're gonna have a .txt file with the sentences that feature both the word and the tense.
Be sure to doawnload the .json file as well for advanced verb search.
Enjoy!
